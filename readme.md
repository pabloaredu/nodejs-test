## Nodejs Test
Streams to consume data and make readable reports and logs.

## Getting Started
There are 2 scripts, stream.js and myscript.js

stream.js -> it consumes text from a file "mydata.txt" (for demonstrative purposes) and gives a human readable report of every piece of data received in a text file (create a text file mydata.txt for testing).

To run: node stream.js

myscript.js -> it reads the report and gives the number of lines and growth rate.

To run: node myscript.js report.txt


## Prerequisites
Built with node.js and no third-party modules.
